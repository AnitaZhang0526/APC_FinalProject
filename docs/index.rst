Welcome to XRD/FTIR Analysis Tool Suite's documentation!
========================================================
The tool is designed to automatically extract information from XRD and FTIR data through profile fitting and data matching.

XRD data will provide information about a material's crystal structure, and FTRI will provide information about a material's bond structure.
